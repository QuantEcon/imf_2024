# Modern Computational Economics and Policy Applications

A workshop for the IMF's Institute for Capacity Development

## Abstract

Open source scientific computing environments built around the Python
programming language have expanded rapidly in recent years. They now form the
dominant paradigm in artificial intelligence and many fields within the natural
sciences.  Economists can greatly enhance their modeling and data processing
capabilities by exploiting Python's scientific ecosystem.  This course will
cover the foundations of Python programming and Python scientific libraries, as
well as showing how they can be used in economic applications for rapid
development and high performance computing.

## Instructors

Chase Coleman is a computational economist based at New York University where
he is a visiting assistant professor. He was an early contributor at QuantEcon
and, along with other members of QuantEcon, has given lectures and workshops
on Python, Julia, and other open source computational tools at institutions and
universities all around the world.

John Stachurski is a mathematical and computational economist based at the
Australian National University who works on algorithms at the intersection of
dynamic programming, Markov dynamics, economics, and finance.  His work is
published in such journals as Econometrica, the Journal of Finance, Automatica,
and Operations Research.  In 2016 he co-founded QuantEcon with Thomas J.
Sargent.
