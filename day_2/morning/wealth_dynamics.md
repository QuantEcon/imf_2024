## Preamble: The Lorenz curve and Gini coefficiet


### Definition

Let $w_1, \ldots, w_n$ be a sample of observations of wealth in a population.

Suppose that $w_1, \ldots, w_n$ has been sorted from smallest to largest.

The Lorenz curve takes this sample and produces a curve $L$.

To create it we first generate data points $(x_i, y_i)$  according to

\begin{equation*}
    x_i = \frac{i}{n},
    \qquad
    y_i = \frac{\sum_{j \leq i} w_j}{\sum_{j \leq n} w_j},
    \qquad i = 1, \ldots, n
\end{equation*}

Now the Lorenz curve $L$ is formed from these data points using interpolation.

The meaning of the statement $y = L(x)$ is that the lowest $(100 \times x)$\% of
people have $(100 \times y)$\% of all wealth.

* if $x=0.5$ and $y=0.1$, then the bottom 50% of the population
  owns 10% of the wealth.

In the discussion above we focused on wealth but the same ideas apply to
income, consumption, etc.

+++

### Simulated data

In the next figure, we generate $n=2000$ draws from a lognormal
distribution and treat these draws as our population.  

We then generate the Lorenz curve using a routine from `quantecon`.

The straight line ($x=L(x)$ for all $x$) corresponds to perfect equality.  

The lognormal draws produce a less equal distribution.  

For example, if we imagine these draws as being observations of wealth across a
sample of households, then the dashed lines show that the bottom 80\% of
households own just over 40\% of total wealth.

```{code-cell} ipython3
n = 2000
sample = np.exp(np.random.randn(n))
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
f_vals, l_vals = qe.lorenz_curve(sample)
ax.plot(f_vals, l_vals, label=f'lognormal sample', lw=2)
ax.plot(f_vals, f_vals, label='equality', lw=2)
ax.legend(fontsize=12)
ax.vlines([0.8], [0.0], [0.43], alpha=0.5, colors='k', ls='--')
ax.hlines([0.43], [0], [0.8], alpha=0.5, colors='k', ls='--')
ax.set_ylim((0, 1))
ax.set_xlim((0, 1))
plt.show()
```

```




## The Gini coefficient

### Definition


Continuing to assume that $w_1, \ldots, w_n$ has been sorted from smallest to largest,
the Gini coefficient of the sample is defined by

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:gini}
    G :=
    \frac
        {\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j = 1}^n |w_j - w_i|}
        {2n\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}.
\end{equation}



### Simulated data

Let's examine the Gini coefficient in some simulations using `gini_coefficient`
from `quantecon`.

The following code computes the Gini coefficients for five different
populations.

Each of these populations is generated by drawing from a 
lognormal distribution with parameters $\mu$ (mean) and $\sigma$ (standard deviation).

To create the five populations, we vary $\sigma$ over a grid of length $5$
between $0.2$ and $4$.

In each case we set $\mu = - \sigma^2 / 2$, so that the mean of the distribution does not change with $\sigma$. 


```{code-cell} ipython3
k = 5
σ_vals = np.linspace(0.2, 4, k)
n = 2_000

ginis = []

for σ in σ_vals:
    μ = -σ**2 / 2
    y = np.exp(μ + σ * np.random.randn(n))
    ginis.append(qe.gini_coefficient(y))

```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(σ_vals, ginis, marker='o')
ax.set_xlabel('$\sigma$', fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel('Gini coefficient', fontsize=12)
plt.show()
```

The plots show that inequality rises with $\sigma$ (as measured by the Gini coefficient).

## Wealth dynamics: Numba version


The model we will study is

```{math}
:label: wealth_dynam_ah

w_{t+1} = (1 + r_{t+1}) s(w_t) + y_{t+1}
```

where

- $w_t$ is wealth at time $t$ for a given household,
- $r_t$ is the rate of return of financial assets,
- $y_t$ is current non-financial (e.g., labor) income and
- $s(w_t)$ is current wealth net of consumption

Letting $\{z_t\}$ be a correlated state process of the form

$$
z_{t+1} = a z_t + b + \sigma_z \epsilon_{t+1}
$$

we’ll assume that

$$
R_t := 1 + r_t = c_r \exp(z_t) + \exp(\mu_r + \sigma_r \xi_t)
$$

and

$$
y_t = c_y \exp(z_t) + \exp(\mu_y + \sigma_y \zeta_t)
$$

Here $\{ (\epsilon_t, \xi_t, \zeta_t) \}$ is IID and standard
normal in $\mathbb R^3$.

The value of $c_r$ should be close to zero, since rates of return
on assets do not exhibit large trends.

When we simulate a population of households, we will assume all shocks are idiosyncratic (i.e.,  specific to individual households and independent across them).

Regarding the savings function $s$, our default model will be

```{math}
:label: sav_ah

s(w) = s_0 w \cdot \mathbb 1\{w \geq \hat w\}
```

where $s_0$ is a positive constant.

Thus, for $w < \hat w$, the household saves nothing. For
$w \geq \bar w$, the household saves a fraction $s_0$ of
their wealth.

We are using something akin to a fixed savings rate model, while
acknowledging that low wealth households tend to save very little.

## Implementation

Here's some type information to help Numba.

```{code-cell} ipython3

wealth_dynamics_data = [
    ('w_hat',  float64),    # savings parameter
    ('s_0',    float64),    # savings parameter
    ('c_y',    float64),    # labor income parameter
    ('μ_y',    float64),    # labor income paraemter
    ('σ_y',    float64),    # labor income parameter
    ('c_r',    float64),    # rate of return parameter
    ('μ_r',    float64),    # rate of return parameter
    ('σ_r',    float64),    # rate of return parameter
    ('a',      float64),    # aggregate shock parameter
    ('b',      float64),    # aggregate shock parameter
    ('σ_z',    float64),    # aggregate shock parameter
    ('z_mean', float64),    # mean of z process
    ('z_var', float64),     # variance of z process
    ('y_mean', float64),    # mean of y process
    ('R_mean', float64)     # mean of R process
]
```

Here's a class that stores instance data and implements methods that update
the aggregate state and household wealth.

```{code-cell} ipython3

@jitclass(wealth_dynamics_data)

    def __init__(self,

        return parameters

    def update_states(self, w, z):

            wp += R * s_0 * w
        return wp, zp
```

Here's function to simulate the time series of wealth for in individual households.

```{code-cell} ipython3

@njit
def wealth_time_series(wdy, w_0, n):
    """
    Generate a single time series of length n for wealth given
    initial value w_0.

    The initial persistent state z_0 for each household is drawn from
    the stationary distribution of the AR(1) process.

        * wdy: an instance of WealthDynamics
        * w_0: scalar
        * n: int


    """
    z = wdy.z_mean + np.sqrt(wdy.z_var) * np.random.randn()
    w = np.empty(n)
    w[0] = w_0
    for t in range(n-1):
        w[t+1], z = wdy.update_states(w[t], z)
    return w
```

Now here's function to simulate a cross section of households forward in time.

Note the use of parallelization to speed up computation.

```{code-cell} ipython3

@njit(parallel=True)
def update_cross_section(wdy, w_distribution, shift_length=500):
    """
    Shifts a cross-section of household forward in time

    * wdy: an instance of WealthDynamics
    * w_distribution: array_like, represents current cross-section

    Takes a current distribution of wealth values as w_distribution
    and updates each w_t in w_distribution to w_{t+j}, where
    j = shift_length.

    Returns the new distribution.

    """
    new_distribution = np.empty_like(w_distribution)

    # Update each household
    for i in prange(len(new_distribution)):
        z = wdy.z_mean + np.sqrt(wdy.z_var) * np.random.randn()
        w = w_distribution[i]
        for t in range(shift_length-1):
            w, z = wdy.update_states(w, z)
        new_distribution[i] = w
    return new_distribution
```

Parallelization is very effective in the function above because the time path
of each household can be calculated independently once the path for the
aggregate state is known.

## Applications

Let's try simulating the model at different parameter values and investigate
the implications for the wealth distribution.

### Time Series

Let's look at the wealth dynamics of an individual household.

```{code-cell} ipython3
wdy = WealthDynamics()
ts_length = 200
w = wealth_time_series(wdy, wdy.y_mean, ts_length)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(w)
plt.show()
```

Notice the large spikes in wealth over time.

Such spikes are similar to what we observed in time series when {doc}`we studied Kesten processes <kesten_processes>`.

### Inequality Measures

Let's look at how inequality varies with returns on financial assets.

The next function generates a cross section and then computes the Lorenz
curve and Gini coefficient.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def generate_lorenz_and_gini(wdy, num_households=100_000, T=500):
    """
    Generate the Lorenz curve data and gini coefficient corresponding to a
    WealthDynamics mode by simulating num_households forward to time T.
    """
    ψ_0 = np.full(num_households, wdy.y_mean)
    z_0 = wdy.z_mean

    ψ_star = update_cross_section(wdy, ψ_0, shift_length=T)
    return qe.gini_coefficient(ψ_star), qe.lorenz_curve(ψ_star)
```

Now we investigate how the Lorenz curves associated with the wealth distribution change as return to savings varies.

The code below plots Lorenz curves for three different values of $\mu_r$.

If you are running this yourself, note that it will take one or two minutes to execute.

This is unavoidable because we are executing a CPU intensive task.

In fact the code, which is JIT compiled and parallelized, runs extremely fast relative to the number of computations.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
μ_r_vals = (0.0, 0.025, 0.05)
gini_vals = []

for μ_r in μ_r_vals:
    wdy = WealthDynamics(μ_r=μ_r)
    gv, (f_vals, l_vals) = generate_lorenz_and_gini(wdy)
    ax.plot(f_vals, l_vals, label=f'$\psi^*$ at $\mu_r = {μ_r:0.2}$')
    gini_vals.append(gv)

ax.plot(f_vals, f_vals, label='equality')
ax.legend(loc="upper left")
plt.show()
```

The Lorenz curve shifts downwards as returns on financial income rise, indicating a rise in inequality.

We will look at this again via the Gini coefficient immediately below, but
first consider the following image of our system resources when the code above
is executing:

Since the code is both efficiently JIT compiled and fully parallelized, it's
close to impossible to make this sequence of tasks run faster without changing
hardware.

Now let's check the Gini coefficient.

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(μ_r_vals, gini_vals, label='gini coefficient')
ax.set_xlabel("$\mu_r$")
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

Once again, we see that inequality increases as returns on financial income
rise.

Let's finish this section by investigating what happens when we change the
volatility term $\sigma_r$ in financial returns.


```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
σ_r_vals = (0.35, 0.45, 0.52)
gini_vals = []

for σ_r in σ_r_vals:
    wdy = WealthDynamics(σ_r=σ_r)
    gv, (f_vals, l_vals) = generate_lorenz_and_gini(wdy)
    ax.plot(f_vals, l_vals, label=f'$\psi^*$ at $\sigma_r = {σ_r:0.2}$')
    gini_vals.append(gv)

ax.plot(f_vals, f_vals, label='equality')
ax.legend(loc="upper left")
plt.show()
```

### Pareto tails

In most countries, the cross-sectional distribution of wealth exhibits a Pareto
tail (power law).


Let's see if our model can replicate this stylized fact by running a simulation
that generates a cross-section of wealth and generating a suitable rank-size plot.

We will use the function `rank_size` from `quantecon` library.

In the limit, data that obeys a power law generates a straight line.  

For sample size and initial conditions, use

```{code-cell} ipython3
num_households = 250_000
T = 500                                      # shift forward T periods
ψ_0 = np.full(num_households, wdy.y_mean)   # initial distribution
z_0 = wdy.z_mean
```

First let's generate the distribution:

```{code-cell} ipython3
num_households = 250_000
T = 500  # how far to shift forward in time
wdy = WealthDynamics()
ψ_0 = np.full(num_households, wdy.y_mean)
z_0 = wdy.z_mean

ψ_star = update_cross_section(wdy, ψ_0, shift_length=T)
```

Now let's see the rank-size plot:

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

rank_data, size_data = qe.rank_size(ψ_star, c=0.001)
ax.loglog(rank_data, size_data, 'o', markersize=3.0, alpha=0.5)
ax.set_xlabel("log rank")
ax.set_ylabel("log size")

plt.show()
```

## JAX version

To illustrate, let us define a function `lorenz_curve_jax` that returns the cumulative share of people and the cumulative share of income earned.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@jax.jit
def lorenz_curve_jax(y):
    n = y.shape[0]
    y = jnp.sort(y)
    s = jnp.concatenate((jnp.zeros(1), jnp.cumsum(y)))
    _cum_p = jnp.arange(1, n + 1) / n
    cum_income = s / s[n]
    cum_people = jnp.concatenate((jnp.zeros(1), _cum_p))
    return cum_people, cum_income
```

Let's suppose that

```{code-cell} ipython3
n = 10_000                                              # Size of sample
rand_key = jax.random.PRNGKey(101)                      # Set random key
w = jnp.exp(jax.random.normal(rand_key, shape=(n,)))    # Lognormal draws
```

is data representing the wealth of 10,000 households.

We can compute and plot the Lorenz curve as follows:

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time

f_vals, l_vals = lorenz_curve_jax(w)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time

# This will be much faster as it will use the jitted function
f_vals, l_vals = lorenz_curve_jax(w)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(f_vals, l_vals, label='Lorenz curve, lognormal sample')
ax.plot(f_vals, f_vals, label='Lorenz curve, equality')
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

Here is another example, which shows how the Lorenz curve shifts as the
underlying distribution changes.

We generate 10,000 observations using the Pareto distribution with a range of
parameters, and then compute the Lorenz curve corresponding to each set of
observations.

```{code-cell} ipython3
a_vals = (1, 2, 5)              # Pareto tail index
n = 10_000                      # size of each sample
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
for a in a_vals:
    rand_key = jax.random.PRNGKey(a*100)
    u = jax.random.uniform(rand_key, shape=(n,))
    y = u**(-1/a)                    # distributed as Pareto with tail index a
    f_vals, l_vals = lorenz_curve_jax(y)
    ax.plot(f_vals, l_vals, label=f'$a = {a}$')

ax.plot(f_vals, f_vals, label='equality')
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

You can see that, as the tail parameter of the Pareto distribution increases, inequality decreases.

This is to be expected, because a higher tail index implies less weight in the tail of the Pareto distribution.

### The Gini Coefficient

The definition and interpretation of the Gini coefficient can be found on the corresponding [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient).

We can test it on the Weibull distribution with parameter $a$, where the Gini coefficient is known to be

$$
G = 1 - 2^{-1/a}
$$

Let's define a function to compute the Gini coefficient.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@jax.jit
def gini_jax(y):
    n = y.shape[0]
    g_sum = 0

    def sum_y_gini(i, g_sum):
        g_sum += jnp.sum(jnp.abs(y[i] - y))
        return g_sum
    
    g_sum = jax.lax.fori_loop(0, n, sum_y_gini, 0)
    return g_sum / (2 * n * jnp.sum(y))
```

Let's see if the Gini coefficient computed from a simulated sample matches
this at each fixed value of $a$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
a_vals = range(1, 20)
ginis = []
ginis_theoretical = []
n = 100

for a in a_vals:
    rand_key = jax.random.PRNGKey(a)
    y = jax.random.weibull_min(rand_key, 1, a, shape=(n,))
    ginis.append(gini_jax(y))
    ginis_theoretical.append(1 - 2**(-1/a))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(a_vals, ginis, label='estimated gini coefficient')
ax.plot(a_vals, ginis_theoretical, label='theoretical gini coefficient')
ax.legend()
ax.set_xlabel("Weibull parameter $a$")
ax.set_ylabel("Gini coefficient")
plt.show()
```

The simulation shows that the fit is good.

## A Model of Wealth Dynamics

Having discussed inequality measures, let us now turn to wealth dynamics.

The model we will study is

```{math}
:label: wealth_dynam_ah

w_{t+1} = (1 + r_{t+1}) s(w_t) + y_{t+1}
```

where

- $w_t$ is wealth at time $t$ for a given household,
- $r_t$ is the rate of return of financial assets,
- $y_t$ is current non-financial (e.g., labor) income and
- $s(w_t)$ is current wealth net of consumption

## Implementation using JAX

Let's define a model to represent the wealth dynamics.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# NamedTuple Model

Model = namedtuple("Model", ("w_hat", "s_0", "c_y", "μ_y",
                             "σ_y", "c_r", "μ_r", "σ_r", "a",
                             "b", "σ_z", "z_mean", "z_var", "y_mean"))
```

Here's a function to create the Model with the given parameters

```{code-cell} ipython3
def create_wealth_model(w_hat=1.0,
                        s_0=0.75,
                        c_y=1.0,
                        μ_y=1.0,
                        σ_y=0.2,
                        c_r=0.05,
                        μ_r=0.1,
                        σ_r=0.5,
                        a=0.5,
                        b=0.0,
                        σ_z=0.1):
    """
    Create a wealth model with given parameters and return
    and instance of NamedTuple Model.
    """
    z_mean = b / (1 - a)
    z_var = σ_z**2 / (1 - a**2)
    exp_z_mean = jnp.exp(z_mean + z_var / 2)
    R_mean = c_r * exp_z_mean + jnp.exp(μ_r + σ_r**2 / 2)
    y_mean = c_y * exp_z_mean + jnp.exp(μ_y + σ_y**2 / 2)
    # Test a stability condition that ensures wealth does not diverge
    # to infinity.
    α = R_mean * s_0
    if α >= 1:
        raise ValueError("Stability condition failed.")
    return Model(w_hat=w_hat, s_0=s_0, c_y=c_y, μ_y=μ_y,
                 σ_y=σ_y, c_r=c_r, μ_r=μ_r, σ_r=σ_r, a=a,
                 b=b, σ_z=σ_z, z_mean=z_mean, z_var=z_var, y_mean=y_mean)
```

The following function updates one period with the given current wealth and persistent state.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def update_states_jax(arrays, wdy, size, rand_key):
    """
    Update one period, given current wealth w and persistent
    state z. They are stored in the form of tuples under the arrays argument
    """
    # Unpack w and z
    w, z = arrays

    rand_key, *subkey = jax.random.split(rand_key, 3)
    zp = wdy.a * z + wdy.b + wdy.σ_z * jax.random.normal(rand_key, shape=size)

    # Update wealth
    y = wdy.c_y * jnp.exp(zp) + jnp.exp(
                        wdy.μ_y + wdy.σ_y * jax.random.normal(subkey[0], shape=size))
    wp = y

    R = wdy.c_r * jnp.exp(zp) + jnp.exp(
                        wdy.μ_r + wdy.σ_r * jax.random.normal(subkey[1], shape=size))
    wp += (w >= wdy.w_hat) * R * wdy.s_0 * w
    return wp, zp
```

Here’s function to simulate the time series of wealth for individual households using a `for` loop and JAX.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Using JAX and for loop

def wealth_time_series_for_loop_jax(w_0, n, wdy, size, rand_seed=1):
    """
    Generate a single time series of length n for wealth given
    initial value w_0.

        * wdy: NamedTuple Model
        * w_0: scalar/vector
        * n: int
        * size: size/shape of the w_0
        * rand_seed: int (Used to generate PRNG key)
    """
    rand_key = jax.random.PRNGKey(rand_seed)
    rand_key, *subkey = jax.random.split(rand_key, n)

    w_0 = jax.device_put(w_0).reshape(size)

    z = wdy.z_mean + jnp.sqrt(wdy.z_var) * jax.random.normal(rand_key, shape=size)
    w = [w_0]
    for t in range(n-1):
        w_, z = update_states_jax((w[t], z), wdy, size, subkey[t])
        w.append(w_)
    return jnp.array(w)
```

Let's try simulating the model at different parameter values and investigate the implications for the wealth distribution using the above function.

```{code-cell} ipython3
wdy = create_wealth_model() # default model
ts_length = 200
size = (1,)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time

w_jax_result = wealth_time_series_for_loop_jax(wdy.y_mean,
                                               ts_length, wdy, size).block_until_ready()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(w_jax_result)
plt.show()
```

We can further try to optimize and speed up the compile time of the above function by replacing `for` loop with [`jax.lax.scan`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.scan.html).

```{code-cell} ipython3
def wealth_time_series_jax(w_0, n, wdy, size, rand_seed=1):
    """
    Generate a single time series of length n for wealth given
    initial value w_0.

    * This implementation uses `jax.lax.scan`.

    The initial persistent state z_0 for each household is drawn from

        * wdy: NamedTuple Model
        * w_0: scalar/vector
        * n: int
        * size: size/shape of the w_0
        * rand_seed: int (Used to generate PRNG key)
    """
    rand_key = jax.random.PRNGKey(rand_seed)
    rand_key, *subkey = jax.random.split(rand_key, n)

    w_0 = jax.device_put(w_0).reshape(size)
    z_init = wdy.z_mean + jnp.sqrt(wdy.z_var) * jax.random.normal(rand_key, shape=size)
    arrays = w_0, z_init
    rand_sub_keys = jnp.array(subkey)

    w_final = jnp.array([w_0])

    # Define the function for each update
    def update_w_z(arrays, rand_sub_key):
        wp, zp = update_states_jax(arrays, wdy, size, rand_sub_key)
        return (wp, zp), wp

    arrays_last, w_values = jax.lax.scan(update_w_z, arrays, rand_sub_keys)
    return jnp.concatenate((w_final, w_values))

# Create the jit function
wealth_time_series_jax = jax.jit(wealth_time_series_jax, static_argnums=(1,3,))
```

Let's try simulating the model at different parameter values and investigate the implications for the wealth distribution and also observe the difference in time between `wealth_time_series_jax` and `wealth_time_series_for_loop_jax`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
wdy = create_wealth_model() # default model
ts_length = 200
size = (1,)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time

w_jax_result = wealth_time_series_jax(wdy.y_mean, ts_length, wdy, size).block_until_ready()
```

Running the above function again will be even faster because of JAX's JIT.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time

# 2nd time is expected to be very fast because of JIT
w_jax_result = wealth_time_series_jax(wdy.y_mean, ts_length, wdy, size).block_until_ready()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(w_jax_result)
plt.show()
```

Now here’s function to simulate a cross section of households forward in time.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def update_cross_section_jax(w_distribution, shift_length, wdy, size, rand_seed=2):
    """
    Shifts a cross-section of household forward in time

    * wdy: NamedTuple Model
    * w_distribution: array_like, represents current cross-section

    Takes a current distribution of wealth values as w_distribution
    and updates each w_t in w_distribution to w_{t+j}, where
    j = shift_length.

    Returns the new distribution.
    """
    new_dist = wealth_time_series_jax(w_distribution, shift_length, wdy, size, rand_seed)
    new_distribution = new_dist[-1, :]
    return new_distribution


# Create the jit function
update_cross_section_jax = jax.jit(update_cross_section_jax, static_argnums=(1,3,))
```

## Applications

Let's try simulating the model at different parameter values and investigate
the implications for the wealth distribution.


### Inequality Measures

Let's look at how inequality varies with returns on financial assets.

The next function generates a cross section and then computes the Lorenz
curve and Gini coefficient.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def generate_lorenz_and_gini_jax(wdy, num_households=100_000, T=500):
    """
    Generate the Lorenz curve data and gini coefficient corresponding to a
    WealthDynamics mode by simulating num_households forward to time T.
    """
    size = (num_households, )
    ψ_0 = jnp.full(size, wdy.y_mean)
    ψ_star = update_cross_section_jax(ψ_0, T, wdy, size)
    return gini_jax(ψ_star), lorenz_curve_jax(ψ_star)

# Create the jit function
generate_lorenz_and_gini_jax = jax.jit(generate_lorenz_and_gini_jax,
                                       static_argnums=(1,2,))
```

Now we investigate how the Lorenz curves associated with the wealth distribution change as return to savings varies.

The code below plots Lorenz curves for three different values of $\mu_r$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
μ_r_vals = (0.0, 0.025, 0.05)
gini_vals = []

for μ_r in μ_r_vals:
    wdy = create_wealth_model(μ_r=μ_r)
    gv, (f_vals, l_vals) = generate_lorenz_and_gini_jax(wdy)
    ax.plot(f_vals, l_vals, label=f'$\psi^*$ at $\mu_r = {μ_r:0.2}$')
    gini_vals.append(gv)

ax.plot(f_vals, f_vals, label='equality')
ax.legend(loc="upper left")
plt.show()
```

The Lorenz curve shifts downwards as returns on financial income rise, indicating a rise in inequality.

Now let's check the Gini coefficient.

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(μ_r_vals, gini_vals, label='gini coefficient')
ax.set_xlabel("$\mu_r$")
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

Once again, we see that inequality increases as returns on financial income
rise.

Let's finish this section by investigating what happens when we change the
volatility term $\sigma_r$ in financial returns.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
σ_r_vals = (0.35, 0.45, 0.52)
gini_vals = []

for σ_r in σ_r_vals:
    wdy = create_wealth_model(σ_r=σ_r)
    gv, (f_vals, l_vals) = generate_lorenz_and_gini_jax(wdy)
    ax.plot(f_vals, l_vals, label=f'$\psi^*$ at $\sigma_r = {σ_r:0.2}$')
    gini_vals.append(gv)

ax.plot(f_vals, f_vals, label='equality')
ax.legend(loc="upper left")
plt.show()
```

We see that greater volatility has the effect of increasing inequality in this model.

## Exercises

```{exercise}
:label: wd_ex1

For a wealth or income distribution with Pareto tail, a higher tail index suggests lower inequality.

Indeed, it is possible to prove that the Gini coefficient of the Pareto
distribution with tail index $a$ is $1/(2a - 1)$.

To the extent that you can, confirm this by simulation.

In particular, generate a plot of the Gini coefficient against the tail index
using both the theoretical value just given and the value computed from a sample via `gini_jax`.

For the values of the tail index, use `a_vals = jnp.linspace(1, 10, 25)`.

Use sample of size 1,000 for each $a$ and the sampling method for generating Pareto draws employed in the discussion of Lorenz curves for the Pareto distribution.

To the extent that you can, interpret the monotone relationship between the
Gini index and $a$.
```

```{solution-start} wd_ex1
:class: dropdown
```

Here is one solution, which produces a good match between theory and
simulation.

```{code-cell} ipython3
a_vals = jnp.linspace(1, 10, 25)  # Pareto tail index
ginis = []

n = 1000                         # size of each sample
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
for i, a in enumerate(a_vals):
    rand_key = jax.random.PRNGKey(i*10)
    u = jax.random.uniform(rand_key, shape=(n,))
    y = u**(-1/a)
    ginis.append(gini_jax(y))
ax.plot(a_vals, ginis, label='sampled')
ax.plot(a_vals, 1/(2*a_vals - 1), label='theoretical')
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

In general, for a Pareto distribution, a higher tail index implies less weight
in the right hand tail.

This means less extreme values for wealth and hence more equality.

More equality translates to a lower Gini index.

```{solution-end}
```

```{exercise-start}
:label: wd_ex2
```

When savings is constant, the wealth process has the same quasi-linear
structure as a Kesten process, with multiplicative and additive shocks.

The Kesten--Goldie theorem tells us that Kesten processes have Pareto tails under a range of parameterizations.

The theorem does not directly apply here, since savings is not always constant and since the multiplicative and additive terms in {eq}`wealth_dynam_ah` are not IID.

At the same time, given the similarities, perhaps Pareto tails will arise.

To test this, run a simulation that generates a cross-section of wealth and
generate a rank-size plot.

In viewing the plot, remember that Pareto tails generate a straight line.  Is
this what you see?

For sample size and initial conditions, use

```{code-cell} ipython3
num_households = 250_000
T = 500 # Shift forward T periods
ψ_0 = jnp.full((num_households, ), wdy.y_mean) # Initial distribution
```

```{exercise-end}
```

```{solution-start} wd_ex2
:class: dropdown
```

First let's generate the distribution:

```{code-cell} ipython3
num_households = 250_000
T = 500  # how far to shift forward in time
size = (num_households, )

wdy = create_wealth_model()
ψ_0 = jnp.full(size, wdy.y_mean)
ψ_star = update_cross_section_jax(ψ_0, T, wdy, size)
```

Let's define a function to get the rank data

```{code-cell} ipython3
def rank_size(data, c=1):
    w = -jnp.sort(-data)                  # Reverse sort
    w = w[:int(len(w) * c)]               # extract top (c * 100)%
    rank_data = jnp.arange(len(w)) + 1
    size_data = w
    return rank_data, size_data
```

Now let's see the rank-size plot:

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

rank_data, size_data = rank_size(ψ_star, c=0.001)
ax.loglog(rank_data, size_data, 'o', markersize=3.0, alpha=0.5)
ax.set_xlabel("log rank")
ax.set_ylabel("log size")

plt.show()
```

```{solution-end}
```
